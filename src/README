# Steps to create MPI jobs to run the garfiled simulation.

1.- Copy the src directory to your home directory in RAAD (don't run in /panfs/vol/HEP/GarfieldSim/PRO/)
    (i.e.   cp -rf /panfs/vol/HEP/GarfieldSim/PRO/src/*   /home/USER/SOMEFOLDER)


2.-  Initialize the environment for MPI
     (i.e. source initialize.sh)

3.-  Compile the code 
     make 

4.-  Create the MPI jobs 

     Number of cpus, Number of events, gas mixture and penning transfer are defined in 
     create_mpijobs.sh  (default values are 64 cpus, 5000 events, arco2 gas mixture and 0.4 pennin transfer) 
     edit the file according to the configuration needed.  

     Once conditions above are fixed then we just execute the bash script according to the study 
     needed. 
     (i.e.     ./create_mpijobs.sh <analysis>,  where <analysis> can be: gain, gasgapscan, holesize, etc.....)
     
     This will automatically create MPI jobs for required configurations considering ANSYS files located in:

     /panfs/vol/HEP/GarfieldSim/PRO/ANSYS/

5.-  Submit the jobs: 

     (i.e.  qsub gapminus02pv2867.job)
        
     the output root file will stored in the same folder.
